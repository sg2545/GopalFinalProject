With indie rock being so broad, individual trends have phased in and out of the genre, with a notable one being Riot Grrrl, a feminist influenced subgenre which dominated the 1990s. Dan DiPiero, of The Ohio State University, explores the trends of feminism in the genre post 1995 Riot Grrrl, recategorizing it to better fit modern times. DiPiero’s statement is that this new trend in the indie genre fits under the label, “Big Feelings” which he describes as “a particular, limited effect.” This effect is “indicative of some of the aesthetic and political shifts that indie rock has undergone in the past decade” (DiPiero 17, 2021). DiPiero defines the trend in a list of five key characteristics: it involves women and queer people, speaks about feelings and abstract emotion, invokes nostalgia from the 90s, has a harmonic vocabulary, and has a strong melody from a singer-songwriter perspective (DiPiero 18-20, 2021). DiPiero cites songs such as Snail Mail’s “Heat Wave” and Soccer Mommy’s “Cool” to contextualize the “Big Feelings” sound for audiences. Based on DiPiero’s argument, the existence of this trend is so important because it is indicative of the fact that although women are often segregated and pushed away from the rock genre, they still have dominant influence over the indie rock culture. DiPiero’s argument is a good baseline for the genre, but his key characteristics can be expanded upon to show how the genre is socially impactful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     DiPiero’s argument is well supported throughout the piece, making valid claims about the genre as a whole; however, at times, he makes generalizations that apply to an overly wide range of music. Yet, he acknowledges that his claim is a generalization, stating that he believes that “Big Feelings is more of a tendency or an orientation” and not necessarily a strict set of rules that all feminist indie rock songs must abide by (DiPiero 17, 2021). This lack of limitation to the definition of Big Feelings only strengthens DiPiero’s argument, by broadening the scope of songs that could apply as evidence for this effect. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     DiPiero states that Big Feelings is female driven and “concerns feelings and relationships” (DiPiero 17, 2021). As an addendum, I would claim that the fact that Big Feelings is female driven and describes the abstract allows female artists to express their sexuality in a unique way. Although this is less applicable to all the songs in the Big Feelings genre than DiPiero’s original classifications, it is still consistent enough to be noteworthy. What makes the expression of sexuality in songs under the Big Feelings genre unique is that it is emotionally driven and poetic, often describing a sexual relationship in a vulnerable way. Consider the song “Want, Want” off of the album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surrender</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Maggie Rogers. This song is clearly about a relationship with a new sexual partner, with lyrics like. Yet, the sexuality within the lyrics of the song is not about the objectification of a partner, it is about the vulnerability of reclaiming sexual identity and desire, with lyrics such as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can't hide what you desire once you're on it, can't fake what you can't break up with” (Rogers et al, 2022)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uLX4BejXpg?si=hp0kcbGhkHHzQORL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Mitski’s “Liquid Smooth” from her album <i>Lush </i>offers similar evidence. The lyrics describe sexuality while also not being about objectification, instead being about Mitski’s introspective feelings. With Big Feelings, as DiPiero describes it, being feminist and emotional, this expression of sexuality is made possible as a direct result of vulnerability. Mitski cites the feelings she is experiencing as a “a river running through [her] veins,” a lovely choice of imagery to describe sexual thoughts (Mitski, 2012). This refraiming of sexuality as a concept not only is an artistically beautiful choice, but it also takes power away from the sexualization of women, inherent to a misogynistic society. Rogers and Mitski are both Big Feelings musicians, with similar histories as Indie Rock musicians who write their lyrics as poetry. Reclaiming sexual identity as something vulnerable and beautiful combats its use as a weapon. </span></p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bfurc6KcMwk?si=BUGhmo_B04gMrvic" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     DiPiero’s article is a thought provoking observation of a trend that is likely to continue and develop in the future as the political sphere evolves. DiPiero himself starts to answer this question in a continutation of his original piece, focusing on another "Big Feelings" song by Soccer Mommy. The genre has bigger and better things to become, evolving into new commentary on "socio-political crises" (DiPiero 39, 2023). Seeing the shift from Riot Grrrl music as a feminist tool towards Big Feelings poses the question of what the genre will further grow into as the next generation of feminist musicians start contributing, beyond what DiPiero has already named.  </span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/background-of-maggie/">Background of Maggie</a></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
