Out of all of the songs on this album, this song is one of the more autobiographical pieces. Looking at the lyrics, Rogers name drops two friends within this song, Sally and Molly. They are both in relationships, Sally getting married and Molly having a boyfriend. By mentioning that her relationships feel so scary, and that she can’t quite understand how her friends feel, Maggie seems to be saying that she feels socially behind others in her life. Reddit user Responsible_Tower247 points this out in their post: using the experience of others to explain her own feelings is not her criticizing her friends, it is her stating that she can’t understand them because she is not in the same place in life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Considering that this message is what made me relate personally to the song, I thought it provoked a broader question of what makes us feel this way? When you look at this collection of media, which is clearly an extremely small sample of all that exists in the world, it feels obvious that there must be some greater phenomenon pushing people of all types towards this feeling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an extremely broad viewpoint, a way to explain this trend is the inherent need for competition in modern society, and the strive to always be the best. "Don't Forget Me" prompts discussion on this greater societal theme, and in order to address it, we must first understand what it is and where it comes from.</span></p><p><strong>Post Graduation Progression</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Clarity on Fire is a company created by Rachel East and Kristen Walker that was designed for life coaching. They share a podcast where they break down specific topics, such as feeling behind in life. In an episode from 2019, their main argument is that in adolescence, there are clear markers of milestones as people progress through school, and that all peers are following the same markers (East and Walker, 2019). However, starting in college, and certainly in post-grad life, there are no longer clear “indicators of measuring progress anymore” (East and Walker, 2019).  </span></p><figure class="post__image align-left">                                  <img loading="lazy" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-4.36.28-PM.png" alt="Two photos on a white background connected by a black arrow.

Image 2 via Sonali Gopal.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Consider this extremely simplified timeline that I have created. Throughout the early years of our lives, our accomplishments or “big moments” are entirely age dependent: starting kindergarten, becoming a teenager, graduating, and more. Everyone is more or less on the same path through their life. </span></p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2.png" alt="On a white background, four timelines are connected with black arrows to show four different potential paths after high school." width="1514" height="868" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2-xs.png 640w, https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2-sm.png 768w, https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2-md.png 1024w, https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2-lg.png 1366w, https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2-xl.png 1600w, https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/responsive/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-5.20.20-PM-2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Image 1 via Matt Benoit.

Image 9 via Garret Jackson.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Here we have several possible continuations of the timeline. These are just four examples, but there are many more possible paths, even interweaving between the ones presented in the image. Like Rogers mentions in "Don't Forget Me," some friends might get married young, which could seem completely alien to another friend, ultimately highlighting how they are just on different paths. After graduating, as East and Walker discuss, there is no set path that everyone is following, which means the metrics of comparison are now skewed. One’s peers are no longer bound by being the same age and therefore, comparison is much harder to accurately make. However, in a society where we are taught to constantly compete – think salary, class rank, beauty – we are conditioned to make comparisons anyways. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of this comparison like statistics: if you are comparing data with inconsistent metrics, the interpretation and conclusion based on that data will be inaccurate, so we are skewed to think we are more behind than we actually are. It's essentially type 1 error, also known as a false positive. Thus, Maggie Rogers comparing herself to Sally and Molly creates a skewed conclusion of her being behind.</span></p><p><strong>Societal Shifts of Success Indicators</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      In a piece on Journey to HER, author Sarah lays out a timeline that people often feel obligated to adhere to, and then panic when they are not on track with it: build a good career after graduating, get married by 30, have kids by 35 (Sarah, 2024). However, circumstances are changing, moreso than many realize.</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/media/posts/7/Screenshot-2025-05-03-at-12.30.34-PM.png" alt="This is an image of a line graph with a blue line on a white background.

This graph shows on the Y axis, real US home prices, compared to time on the X axis, adjusted for inflation to make a better comparison. This data is specifically looking at homes in Saint Louis for just a consistent point of comparison, sourced from the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the graph, you see a ratio, 0.77 in the above image. This is a measure of the Case-Shiller Home Price Index divided by the Consumer Price Index. The lower the ratio is, the more affordable housing is, so clearly, housing is significantly less affordable than it once was. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     The point of this graph connects back to Sarah’s argument in her piece. In adult life, she states that markers are based on certain big accomplishments in life. She uses getting married and buying a home as one of these examples of markers in life. Generations that came before in middle class American society have pushed the narrative of 'get married, buy a house, have a family' in order to have ‘made it’ in life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, clearly based on housing costs, and generally everything being more expensive than it once was, these tasks of getting married, buying a house, and having a family are much harder than they used to be; therefore, many are having to wait until they are older to achieve this, ultimately contributing to feeling behind. </span></p><p><strong>Synthesis</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Now that we have looked at the way we grow up and the competition it creates, and the shift of metrics like buying a house, I want to talk about why this matters. In order to address an issue embedded in society, we must be aware of it, and we must normalize talking about it. For example, if people never talked about salary, we would never be able to work towards fixing the issue of people being underpaid. Being knowledgeable about the circumstances that contribute to an issue, like constantly being in competition and feeling like we are behind, is how you take power away from the issue. We must be knowledgeable in order to think critically and help ourselves feel better. To reconnect this argument with “Don’t Forget Me,” songs like this are so important because they prompt the critical thinking that is required to fight against the unhealthy competition ingrained in society. For me, this is why I enjoy the song so much. It brings me out of the headspace of competition, and allows me to reassess my priorities in life. If we know we are not alone in our feelings, then maybe one day we will come to realize that there is not anyone that we are actually behind.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/so-what/">So What?</a></p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
