Maggie Rogers wrote “Don’t Forget Me” right before turning 30, a birthday which often prompts feelings of nostalgia. “Don’t Forget Me” is a song of reflection and grappling with the passage of time. This theme relevant to all, even those who do not relate directly to Rogers's situation. Emphasizing its importance to Rogers, the song is the namesake of the album, the longest on the album, and the conclusion of the album. In the song, Rogers comments on the relationships of her friends, essentially stating that she feels mentally behind them. The importance of this song stems from the emotional vulnerability of Rogers’s admittance. By being so personally true, the song encourages others to face their anxieties and confront what it means to grow older, like Rogers is doing. This statement of feeling left behind is especially important, as it is evidence of the issue that society places everyone in constant competition.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Maggie Rogers has an interesting history as an artist. Her discovery came from a viral video of a New York University masterclass, in which Pharrell Williams commented on her song, “Alaska” stating that he had “zero notes” (iamOTHER 23:51, 2016). The virality of this video gave Rogers a platform of popularity to release her first album. However, establishment as an artist made her grapple with objectification and what it means to be a figure as a woman</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This experience contributed to Rogers making the decision to go back to school and obtain her master's degree in Religion and Public Life from Harvard’s Divinity School. She then released her sophomore album, which as she describes in Mark Savage’s article, allowed her to be “not afraid to take up space anymore” (Rogers in Savage, 2022). Considering “Don’t Forget Me,” the song and the album, is a direct biography of Rogers’s life, her past has clearly had an important influence on her artistic choices. The music video itself shows the process of healing; it starts with who Rogers once was, shows her reconnecting with the world, cutting off the pressure she feels, and ends with her in a new phase of her life (Rogers, 2024). The song and album encompass her womanhood, questions of spirituality, the give and take of publicity, and much more. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      During Rogers’ performance of “Don’t Forget Me” on Austin City Limits, audiences witness the live emotional impact of the song. This performance emphasizes the importance of the lyrics using physicality and emotion. As claimed in "The Existential Who Am I?," this combination of verbal and physical performances encourages audiences to face uncertainty, yet still remain hopeful for the future. The performance of “Don’t Forget Me” includes artistic choices that Rogers made to further bolster the meaning of the lyrics and connect back to her history as an artist. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Undeniably, the indie rock genre has issues. There is a tendancy for the genre to be "homogeneous" with little diversity (Segura, 2017). Although this is still a prevalent issue, overal change is occuring, shifting indie rock from marginalizaiton towards the better. In the piece, "Uniquely Female: The Shift of Indie Rock," I dive into the definition of a “Big Feelings” song and explore the impact of the genre. DiPiero states that a key element of “Big Feelings” is the incorporation of femininity, I expand it to consider sexuality within Indie music (DiPiero 17, 2021). The main argument is that “Big Feelings” provides the framework for female artists to redefine sex and relationships in a way that is more vulnerable. This reframing, and taking control of the narrative within a relationship, is an example of female empowerment, and its impact spreads beyond the song itself. Audiences feel this impact themselves; “Big Feelings” songs teach them to re-evaluate their own relationships, and truly consider what they value in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     In "Dear Diary," I use “Don’t Forget Me,” in conjunction with other songs with a similar narrative vibe, to tell the life story of a nameless fictional character. The assignment is structured as a series of diary entries to tell a unique story of this character growing up and learning how to navigate the world. The way “Don’t Forget Me” fits into this narrative indicates the way the song can have importance to so many people living different lives, and although situations may not directly match, the lessons are still applicable. This relatability is also discussed within the piece by Mandy Week and Olivia Worcester. Within the title, they describe “Don’t Forget Me” as a “testament to being a woman in your twenties” (Week and Worcester, 2024). Laura Snapes further explains this relatability, claiming that younger audiences look for songs with heavier emotional meaning (Snapes, 2021). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     "Will the Race Ever End?" further explores the connection between Rogers and her audiences. I delve further into the relatability of the song, using the song as an example of a greater societal theme. I used my final essay to answer the question, “why do we always feel like we are falling behind?” Under a capitalist society, competition is always pushed upon the people, in all contexts — economically, socially, romantically. “Don’t Forget Me” is Rogers’ admittance of this feeling. The comment section of the music video is the audience’s admittance of this feeling. My notes app is my admittance of this feeling. With it being such a common hurt, I used two important sources to address this question with psychological and sociological perspectives, tying it all back to forced competition. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     An influential piece of music moves audiences emotionally, with strong, connective lyrics making audiences look introspectively. “Don’t Forget Me” is a song of healing: admittance and acceptance finally leading to emotional growth. From all iterations of the song, there is an important lesson to ask thought provoking questions about ourselves and the world around us in order to heal.</span></p><p>Listen to "Don't Forget Me": </p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UptUZfqyN4s?si=Ee0mkz7YJBqdHLLb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p class="align-center"><a href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/background-of-maggie/">Background of Maggie</a></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/so-what/">So What?</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
