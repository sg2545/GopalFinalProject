She wrote this album at 29 after graduating from her Master’s program at Harvard Divinity School. The entire album, especially the title track, serving as an autobiography (Shaffer, 2024). The album highlights her hopes and fears for growing older. Her lyrics speak about her friends’ lives: how they are growing up and experiencing a love she finds hard to understand. Rogers believes herself to be “simply in a different place in her life” (Rogers in Paul, 2024). We hear about Rogers’ friends Sally, soon to be married, and Molly, in a relationship lacking real connection. Ultimately, this song is a lesson for how to think about one’s life and their position within the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Rogers’ live performance of “Don’t Forget Me” on Austin City Limits perfectly encapsulated her persona in this era of her life. Live performances have a special magic, especially for indie musicians. As part of her PhD research, Christina Ballico speaks to the importance of live performance, stating that they foster a unique community built around the artistry of music, not the corporateness of music (Ballico, 2011), which this performance contributes to for Rogers. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     This performance premiered on PBS on October 12th, 2024. As it starts, lights illuminate Rogers in the center of the stage: she is wearing a simple yet elegant outfit, surrounded by her band. This outfit is a purposeful choice; its understated color allows Rogers’ art to shine over her but the flowy silhouette of the dancewear skirt allows her to move with the music in a way that is captivating. Playing the guitar while grooving, Rogers exudes coolness. In this performance, Rogers’ voice is nearly identical to the studio quality, easily soaring up and down the scales with little vocal strain; an impressive feat after nearly an hour of performance and constant months on tour. Most special about her vocal performance, however, is her ability to inject emotion directly into her voice. On the second verse, as she sings about her friend Sally’s love, Rogers looks towards the sky, as if asking a higher power to answer her prayers. Considering that Rogers has a history of studying the intersection of music and divinity at Harvard, this was likely intentional, so that audiences could feel the connection too. With lyrics speaking of personal dissatisfaction and this pleading look in her eyes, the performance of this line invokes a powerful feeling of existentialism and just wanting more out of life. In a statement via Rolling Stone magazine, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogers summarizes the song as such: “I don’t have a lot of asks, but I want my time spent on this earth to add up to something. For it all to be worth it in the end” (Rogers via Paul, 2024), a deeply human desire that is only natural to crave. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     What makes this song more than just a likeable melody with a catchy beat? What makes this performance a lesson of value that we can learn from? A main question embedded into the song is whether it is better to accept an unsatisfactory love as a cure for loneliness, or to face forever loneliness instead of compromising on love. To everyone dissatisfied with their current state, wondering if they will ever get the future they want or feeling “behind” where they should be in life, this is an extremely relevant question. Rogers’ vulnerability is important because it encourages introspective conversations among her audience. What is worth giving up in order to achieve the happiness that we deserve? Feeling vulnerable is an intrinsically human characteristic, but admitting to those feelings is certainly no easy feat. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     This song also serves as commentary on the emphasis that society places on romantic relationships, especially for women. No matter how accomplished women are, there is still the everlasting question of “will she ever find love?” When that question is pushed over and over again, through every form of media that we consume, it is no mystery as to why artists like Rogers and women in general crave the having a partner even if it is just to, as Rogers asks in the song “take [her] money” and “wreck [her] Sundays” (Rogers, 2024). Shaffer goes as far as to say that these lyrics are an “act of desperation” for Rogers (Shaffer, 2024). This statement is not intended to look down upon Rogers for wanting this, or to say that wanting love is a bad thing, but it is interesting to note how this craving for a relationship is a feeling experienced by most, the product of our social culture. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     However, with all of this existential questioning that Rogers does, she chooses to switch the tone of the song during the bridge, taking on a more optimistic outlook for the future. By doing this, she believes there to be something better waiting for her, thus causing audiences to reframe their thinking as well. Specifically, in the Austin City Limits live performance, the keyboard player matches this shift in thinking by going into the bridge on a series of ascending notes, mirroring the hope in Rogers’ voice and the smile that flashes on her expression. This portion of the song is an important reminder that although vulnerability is necessary and that it is okay to feel uncertain about one's place in life, there is always the possibility for more in the future if one is open to it.  </span></p><p>     Ultimately, this song and performance is more than just a likeable melody with a catchy beat because it is an example of reframing one's thinking for the better. Rogers demonstrates that vulnerability and admitting to hurt is so important, but without being open to more in the future, then there is no way to heal.</p><p class="align-center"><br><a href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/so-what/">So What?</a></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://sg2545.github.io/GopalFinalProject/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
